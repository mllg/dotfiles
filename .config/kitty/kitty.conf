# Font family. You can also specify different fonts for the
# bold/italic/bold-italic variants. By default they are derived automatically,
# by the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font families
# that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example:
# font_family Operator Mono Book
# bold_font Operator Mono Medium
# italic_font Operator Mono Book Italic
# bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic
# 
# You can get a list of full family names available on your computer by running

# Choose whether to use the system implementation of wcwidth() (used to

# You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut that is
# assigned in the default configuration.
# 
# You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single shortcut, using the
# syntax below:
# map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...
# For example:
# map ctrl+shift+e combine : new_window : next_layout
# this will create a new window and switch to the next available layout
